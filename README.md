## dockerfiles

This repo was inspired by @jessfraz and holds various Dockerfiles for images I use.

The more I use Docker the more I like the idea that most of the things are being launched in a container rather than installed into OS.

Please note, that I use local ~/.apps folder in case I want to map a volume inside container.
